# New-Yorks-Accidents-Analysis

In this project I have created a dashboard illustrating the distribution of accidents in New York City.

While analyzing the data, I discovered that:
- Accidents are evenly distributed, but the highest number occurred on Fridays.
- The highest number of accidents was observed in January and February, at the beginning of the year.
- "Belt Parkway" is the street with the most accidents, accounting for 2%.
- Driver Inattention or Distraction is the most common cause of accidents with injured victims, while unsafe speed is the leading cause of fatal accidents.
